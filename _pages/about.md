I'm a final year undergraduate CS student from Fudan University, seeking for possibility to do a phd.

My research interests are Data Mining and Database. Previously I did several Data Mining Projects at Fudan and did a project about Generative Models at HKUST with Prof. Tong Zhang. I'm always thinking about how can I be unique in this competitive field. As a CS student, I think the answer is doing research on math *and* system. I love math, while I also need to do efficient implementation according to both algorithms and systems.

You can find me CV here [[html](https://haicang.github.io/cv/)/[pdf](https://haicang.github.io/files/HaicangZhou.pdf)].
