## Education

B.S. in computer science, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), 2020
- Overall GPA: 3.69/4.0 (Rank: 14/155); Major GPA: 3.81
- Before CS, I spent 2 wonder years in EE


## Research Experience

Visiting Student @ [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/), advisor: Prof. [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/), 2019.07-2019.08

Research Assistant @ [Fudan](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), advisor: Prof. [Zengfeng Huang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~huangzf/) / Prof. [Yun Xiong](http://www.cs.fudan.edu.cn/?page_id=1979), 2017.05-present



**Disentangled Representation Learning**
Jul. 2019 - Present | Advisor: Prof. Tong Zhang | HKUST 
- This project aims at designing novel methods for disentangled representation learning.
- Utilized generative models, like GAN, VAE and their variants.
- Preliminary experiments are finished on Image Translation task, with Inference GAN architecture. The best model of
Inference GAN is selected and some enhancements are achieved based on the state-of-the-art (5% - 10% gain in IS and
FID).
- Critical vulnerabilities are found in all the existing methods, and more fundamental theories are under investigation.

**Logo Retrieval**
Oct. 2018 - Dec. 2018 | Advisor: Prof. Yun Xiong | Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Fudan University
- Aiming to achieve high accuracy retrieval on logo datasets.
- Utilized a novel unsupervised method based on generative models, Conv-net and Transfer Learning to extract features
from logo images. (Unsupervised method has never been used on this problem that time.)
- The unsupervised method surpasses previous supervised methods, with 2.3% gain on trademark dataset, and it is
effective on our real world dataset where the supervised methods fail.
- This project is sold to a company.

**Storyline Mining**
Jul. 2017 - Sep. 2017 | Advisor: Prof. Yun Xiong | Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Fudan University
- This project aims at extracting information from social media and construct storylines, a series of related things listed chronologically.
- Used Bayesian Networks and NER to extract features.
- More than 10% gain on accuracy and F1 score.
